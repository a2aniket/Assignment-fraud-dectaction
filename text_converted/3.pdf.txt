What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through
experience and by the use of data.!"! It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning
algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make
predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.4! Machine learning algorithms
are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, and computer vision,
where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making
predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of
mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine
learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through
unsupervised learning. 41! In its application across business problems, machine learning is also
referred to as predictive analytics

What is TfidfVectorizer?

Without going into the math, TF-IDF are word frequency scores that try to highlight
words that are more interesting, e.g. frequent in a document but not across documents.
The TfidfVectorizer will tokenize documents, learn the vocabulary and inverse document
frequency weightings, and allow you to encode new documents

What is PorterStemmer?

Over-stemming occurs when two words are stemmed from the same root that are of
different stems. Over-stemming can also be regarded as false-positives.
Under-stemming occurs when two words stem from the same root that are not of
different stems.
